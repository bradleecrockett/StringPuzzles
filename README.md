# String Puzzles
Complete each of the python string processing puzzles below. Some basic testing is provided in the main method. When you are done, push your changes to Github to test your code more thoroughly.

## Cat Dog 
Write a program that takes in a string parameter and returns the boolean value `True` if the string has the same number of occurrences of `'cat'` as it does occurrences of `'dog'` and `False` if it does not.
```python
def cat_dog(mystr):
    # ++ Your code here ++

    return 0
```

## Other End
Given two strings, return True if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring upper/lower case differences (in other words, the computation should not be "case sensitive").

Note: s.lower() returns the lowercase version of a string.
```python
def other_end(str1, str2):
    # ++ your code here ++

    return 0
```


# Count Code
Return the number of times that the string "code" appears anywhere in the given string, except we'll accept any letter for the 'd', so "cope" and "cooe" count


| Function Call | Return Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| count_code('aaacodebbb') | 1 |
| count_code('codexxcode') | 2 |
| count_code('cozexxcopeco6e') | 3 |

```python
def count_code(str):
    # ++ Your code here ++

    return -1

```
